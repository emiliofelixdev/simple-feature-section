## Overview

![screenshot](./assets/desktop_preview.png)

This project is a 3-column feature section built for a DevChallenges project. I focused on making the layout responsive using Flexbox and keeping the code clean with CSS variables.

### What I learned

- **Accessibility:** Using `role="img"` and `aria-label` inside a `<span>` so screen readers can actually understand what the emojis are.
- **Flexbox Spacing:** I learned how to combine `gap` on the card container with specific `margins` on text elements to get the exact spacing from the design.
- **Image Alignment:** Using `margin-top: auto` to force images to the bottom of the card so they stay aligned even if the text lengths are different.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) - My main reference for the container and card alignment.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Used for the Outfit font family.
